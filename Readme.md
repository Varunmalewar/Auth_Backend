# Authentication System Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks:
- [x] Added login functionality to `controller/auth.js`
- [x] Added JWT token generation for successful login
- [x] Updated `routes/user.js` to include login route
- [x] Created `.env` file with required environment variables
- [x] Removed duplicate imports from `controller/auth.js`

## Pending Tasks:
- [ ] Test the signup functionality
- [ ] Test the login functionality
- [ ] Add input validation for both signup and login
- [ ] Implement password reset functionality
- [ ] Add email verification for signup
- [ ] Implement role-based access control

## API Endpoints:
- POST `/api/v1/signup` - User registration
- POST `/api/v1/login` - User login (returns JWT token)

## Environment Variables:
- DATABASE_URL: MongoDB connection string
- JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT token signing
- PORT: Server port (default: 4000)

## Next Steps:
1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Test signup endpoint with Postman/curl
3. Test login endpoint with created user credentials
4. Verify JWT token is properly generated and validated
